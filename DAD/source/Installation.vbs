WScript.echo "This is an extremely basic installation/configuration script for DAD.  Don't expect much!"
WScript.echo "At this point, you should have ALREADY downloaded and installed the most current versions of MySQL, Activestate Perl, Apache, Java and PHP.  When installing PHP you should have enabled the GD2, MySQL, and MySQLi modules.  You should have also configured PHP to work with the family of Apache server that you have installed."

WScript.echo "Please locate and edit the Apache configuration file.  You need to make sure that the server will handle HTML pages using PHP correctly.  To do this, you should have a line in the configuration file that states something like this: AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php .html .htm"
WScript.echo "We recommend that at this time you copy the 'PHP.ini' file from your PHP installation directory into the Windows directory"
wscript.echo "Please open a command prompt and use the 'cd' command to change into the \DAD\source directory.  Once there, please run 'installmodules.bat'"
WScript.echo "It is now time to install the initial data into the database tables.  If you already have data or stored procedures in your MySQL database, DO NOT RUN THIS STEP AUTOMATICALLY!!  The scripts will drop your old data and procedures.  Instead, get someone with database experience to assist you with the remainder of the installation."
WScript.echo "If, after being warned, you are sure that you are ready to import the default data, please open a command prompt and use the 'cd' command to switch to the \DAD\source directory.  Once there run the 'init_db.bat' command.  If you have installed MySQL with a password other than 'All4Fun', please edit this batch script first to use the correct password."
WScript.echo "Please copy the JAR file in the DAD/source/Java directory into the library path for the JVM that you installed.  Typically this would be something like C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_01\lib\ext"
WScript.echo "The only remaining task is for you to create a scheduled job that will run on startup using the credentials that you wish to assign to DAD.  This job should start the start_scheduler.bat script in the DAD/jobs directory."
WScript.echo "Locate the Apache 'httpd.conf' file in the Apache configuration directory.  Open this file in a text editor like Notepad.  Once the file is open, search for 'DocumentRoot'.  Locate the configuration line that specifies where HTML documents will be found by the web server.  Change the path from 'C:\Program Files\Apache...' to 'C:\DAD\web\html', or wherever you have installed DAD on your system.  After making this change, search for 'DocumentRoot' again.  There is a second configuration line that controls permissions to allow you to browse the web pages.  You will find that this is also set the point into the Apache directory.  Adjust this to match the DocumentRoot setting that you configured for DAD."
WScript.echo "Locate the file 'libmysql.dll' in the PHP directory.  Copy this file into the Apache 'bin' directory.  After copying the file, left click on the Apache icon in the icon try and choose to restart the Apache server."
WScript.echo "That's it!  You're done!!!  Open your web browser on the DAD host and browse to 127.0.0.1.  If you have done everything correctly, you are looking at the DAD login screen!"
